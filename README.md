Olympic Games Analysis

I have been going through tutorials and taking course in datacamp.com learning the basics in SQL, Excel and Power Bi. After gaining some skills i decided to start a project that would be to complicated for my skills and knowledge, so i created this project which highlights Visualization, Data cleaning, SQL query and importing files into Power BI.

This was a fun but challenging project to do which gave me new insites and knowledge about the field of Data analysis.
Found this project online and started out with a Business problem and tried to solve the task at hand.

Power BI file attached.

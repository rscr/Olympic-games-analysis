Olympic Games Analysis

I have been going through tutorials and taking courses in datacamp.com learning the basics in SQL, Excel and Power Bi. After gaining some skills i decided to start a project that would be to complicated for my skills and knowledge, so i created this project which highlights Visualization, Data cleaning, SQL query and importing files into Power BI.

This was a fun but challenging project to do which gave me new insites and knowledge about the field of Data analysis.
Found this project online and started out with a Business problem and tried to solve the task at hand.

I have attached the whole Power BI file for closer look at the project, and at the same time attached screenshots of the Business problem, Data cleaning, Data model and Dashboard.

Tool used: Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio and Azure Data Studio. Had to download SQL Express server for this project.
